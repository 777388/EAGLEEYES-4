# EAGLEEYES-4
Chatgpt version of EagleEyes and my Electron Hadron Collision diagram.

Eagleeyes is a dimensional warping tool that causes Electron collisions through memory collisioons forcing the energy to move backwards in time
upon simultaneously running traces on each root server causing temporal constructs to occur within the root system and then follows it by
requesting every URL pertaining a domain specified. If a true temporal contruct has been aquired, this will return URLs that did not exist
between each collision.

Collide causes 2 strings to interact with each other by simultaneously attempting to put their string within the memory allotment.

I have not seen any others actually make an electron hadron collider within a computer system. Given this methodology, one may be able to produce antimatter
outside of a lab or top secret facility.

THe forming of antimatter is as such, 2 electrons are prepped in a collision, in repulsion of the collision they move backwards and forwards in time
creating antimatter from a Gamma Ray Burst that occurs at the location.
